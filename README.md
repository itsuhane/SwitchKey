![switchkey-ui](README.assets/switchkey-ui.png)

- Save current input source choice for frontmost application:  
  click "Add Current".

- Enable/disable automatic switch for saved application:  
  check/uncheck the checkbox on the right.

Not working? See below.

### First Run

Upon first launch, SwitchKey will ask for accessibility permission.  
SwitchKey will open accessibility page, **and exit**.  
After you grant permission, re-launch SwitchKey again.  
The same will happen if you reject the permission later.

### Purchase

I wrote this because I tried some other tools.  
They are either buggy or too cumbersome to configure.  
I payed money and time for them.  
So you don't have to pay for them anymore.
